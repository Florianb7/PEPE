     <h2>Who is Pepe the Frog?</h2>
     <p>
      Pepe the frog was created in 2005 by an artist called Matt Furie. He started life as a simple comic character who loved smoking weed and peeing with his trousers all the way down, however this is not how Matt Furie's creation would come to be known on the internet

     <h2>The memeification of Pepe </h2>
     <p>
    In 2008 users of social media websites like Myspace, Gaia Online and 4chan began to popularise the use of Pepe through memes such as "feels good man" and "feels bad man" to display basic emotions such as happy and sad.
    By 2015 Pepe had become one of the most popular memes seeing a large amount of use in many different internet communities such as 4chan and Tumblr. Users even began creating and selling "rare Pepes" for thousands of dollars.
    By 2016 "The Cult of Kek" formed on 4chan and the politization of Pepe began

     <h2>The Cult of Kek </h2>
     <p>
Although the way the cult of kek formed is quite a long story it can be summarised shortly by explaining that it formed due to a series of unlikely coincidences.
Firstly the name "Kek" originating from World of Warcraft and the Korean language (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kek) it was used for expressing laughter on posts on 4chan, however users later found information about an egyptian diety called Kek "god of chaos" which is relevant in the next series of coincidences.
The 4chan platform assigns a "random" 8 digit code to posts made on their platform, users claimed that the posts with double numbers or triples were favoured by this god of chaos and believed that Kek used these codes to communicate with them.
During the 2016 american presidential elections somone made a post saying "trump will win" with the post code "77777777" which was incredibly lucky, another coincidence that would cause the cult of kek to ally with Donald Trump and view him as a prophet of their diety.

     <h2> Pepe's Political Journey  </h2>
     <p>
After 4chan began creating memes involving Pepe and the presidential candidate Donald Trump they began to circulate online due to Trump sharing them on social media along with other associates of his doing the same.
In reaction to this Hilary Clinton released a article on her website labeling Pepe as a symbol of the "alt-right" and claimed it was a "symbol associated with white supremacy." Since the use of Pepe the frog as a meme had been in mainstream use for a considereble time prior this suprised many people on social media.
However due to this article people began labeling people using the meme in everyday context as alt-right and white supremicists. The article has since been taken down but has been archived here (https://web.archive.org/web/20170215224621/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/).

     <h2> Pepe's Death  </h2>
     <p>
Once Pepe's image became known more for his affiliation with the "alt-right" than for being Matt Furie's original character, he decided to kill off his own creation buy illustrating him in a coffin. Users of 4chan and other sites replied that pepe was no longer his to kill and now belonged to the internet, however Matt Furie remained determined to stop his creation being used to promote negative ideas.

     <h2> Matt Furie's Fight for Pepe  </h2>
     <p>
Matt Furie understood from the internets reaction that he could not fix the problem by just killing his creation, since it became a meme its use was no longer in his control. His next move was to take legal action with the people using Pepe's symbol to spread hate, this began with a poster being sold by infowars a website known for spreading fake news and a childrens book written Eric Hauser which allegedly contained anti islamic metaphors, both of these lawsuits ended in favour of Matt Furie.

      As a final effort to control how pepe was being used Matt Furie launched a kickstarter to fund a new comic with the goal of restoring Pepe into a "universal symbol for peace, love, and acceptance. "
